# Python Garage Inventory System
A simple inventory manager for vehicles, demonstrating basic list operations and text-based file persistence.

## 🚀 Features
* **Inventory Management:** Add new cars or remove existing ones from the garage.
* **Smart Feedback:** Includes logic to check the length of car names during entry.
* **Capacity Tracking:** Instantly count how many vehicles are currently stored.
* **TXT Persistence:** Automatically saves the entire garage list into a `meine_autos.txt` file upon quitting.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **File Handling:** Standard Python `open()` and `write()` functions for text files.

## 🕹️ How to Use
1. **Run the program:** `python your_filename.py`
2. **Commands:** Use `hinzufügen` (add), `entfernen` (remove), `zählen` (count), or `anzeigen` (show) to manage the fleet.
3. **Save & Exit:** Type `quit` to store the data and close the application.

## 🎯 Learning Progress
This project was focused on basic file I/O operations. Using `.txt` files is a great way to understand how raw data can be stored and retrieved, which is a fundamental concept before moving on to more complex formats like JSON or databases.
